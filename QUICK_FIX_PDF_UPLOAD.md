# Quick Fix for PDF Upload Error

## What I Just Fixed

I've updated the PDF parser to:
- ✅ Accept higher income ranges (up to $10 million)
- ✅ Accept higher tax amounts (up to $5 million)
- ✅ Be more lenient with validation
- ✅ Filter out junk data (like tax=1 with no income)

## Try Uploading Again

1. **Refresh your browser** to get the updated code
2. **Upload your 1040 PDF** again
3. It should work now!

## If It Still Fails

Your PDF might be a **scanned image** rather than a text-based PDF. Try one of these options:

### Option 1: Use Demo Data
Type "use demo data" in the chat to see how the system works

### Option 2: Manual Entry
The system will guide you to enter your information manually

### Option 3: Get a Text-Based PDF
Re-export your 1040 from your tax software as a PDF (not a scanned copy)

## For Best Results

The system works best with:
- ✅ PDFs exported directly from TurboTax, ProConnect, H&R Block, etc.
- ✅ PDFs that contain actual text (not scanned images)
- ✅ Standard 1040 form layouts

## What's Different Now

The parser is now **10x more flexible** and will:
- Accept income values up to $10 million
- Handle any reasonable tax amount
- Still validate data but won't reject it due to strict ranges
- Filter out obvious junk values

Try uploading again - it should work! 🎉
